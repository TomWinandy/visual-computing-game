# visual-computing-game

This project was realized by Maxime Rufer, Tom Winandy & Mehdi Zayene in the context of the course CS-211.

This project implements from scratch a game that is controlled by a tangible interface. The user holds a Lego board and moves it in order to play the game. The objective of the game is to touch all the obstacles with a controlled ball by manipulating a real object in front of your webcam. The image below shows a person playing a version of this game (not exactly the one we implemented on a design standpoint).
